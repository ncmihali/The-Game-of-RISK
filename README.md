# Grading policy:
1. Functionalities of the game: need to fulfill all the requirements & bug free. Consider all the corner cases!
2. UML diagram -> first draft(before started codeing) and final draft should not change much
3. Cooperation between team members: use issue, branch, merges
4. CI/CD & test coverage
5. documentation & naming
